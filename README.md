# Clean Code Standards

Welcome to the Clean Code Standards repository! This project is designed to gather, discuss, and implement clean coding practices across different programming languages. By following these standards, developers can write code that is more understandable, maintainable, and efficient.

## Why Clean Code?
Clean code is not just about aesthetics; itâ€™s about making software easier to read, test, and modify. This is crucial in collaborative environments where multiple developers work on the same codebase.

## Contribution Guidelines
1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Create a new branch** for your feature or fix (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. **Make your changes**
4. **Write tests** to validate your changes (if applicable)
5. **Submit a Pull Request** that describes your changes and why they are necessary

## Code Standards by Language
- **JavaScript**: [JavaScript Clean Code](./standards/javascript.md)
- **Python**: [Python Clean Code](./standards/python.md)
- **Java**: [Java Clean Code](./standards/java.md)
- **C#**: [C# Clean Code](./standards/csharp.md)
- **Go**: [Go Clean Code](./standards/go.md)

## Discussions
Feel free to open issues for any discussions or suggestions related to clean code practices, and let's collaborate to improve our coding standards!
