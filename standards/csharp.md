# C# Clean Code Standards

## 1. Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names and method names.
- Use camelCase for local variable names.

## 2. Method Length
- Limit methods to a maximum of 20 lines.
- Aim for methods that perform a single task.

## 3. Properties
- Use properties instead of public fields to enforce encapsulation.
- Keep get and set accessors simple.

## 4. Comments
- Use XML comments for public methods and classes.
- Avoid obvious comments.

## 5. Error Handling
- Use try-catch for exception management.
- Log exceptions with meaningful information.
