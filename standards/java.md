# Java Clean Code Standards

## 1. Naming
- Use meaningful variable, method, and class names following CamelCase.
- Keep names short yet descriptive.

## 2. Methods
- Keep methods small and focused on a single task.
- Use @Override annotation when overriding methods.

## 3. Comments
- Explain why the code does something, not what it does.
- Use Javadoc for public APIs.

## 4. Formatting
- Follow Java Code Conventions for indentation and brackets.
- Place curly braces on the same line as the control statement.

## 5. Error Handling
- Use exceptions to signal problems, not return codes.
