# JavaScript Clean Code Standards

## 1. Variables
- Use `const` or `let` instead of `var`.
- Name variables meaningful and descriptive.

## 2. Functions
- Keep functions small and focused on a single task.
- Use descriptive names for functions that indicate their purpose.

## 3. Comments
- Write comments to explain why something is done, not what is done.
- Avoid redundant comments.

## 4. Formatting
- Use consistent indentation.
- Group related code together.

## 5. Error Handling
- Use try/catch blocks for error handling.
- Provide informative error messages.
